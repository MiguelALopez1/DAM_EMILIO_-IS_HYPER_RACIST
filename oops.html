            There are many types of frictional forces. No matter what math formula is used to describe the magnitude of the frictional force, they all point in the opposite direction of motion, (or the intended motion if there were no friction,) and parallel to the surfaces of contact. The symbol for a frictional force is a cursive &quot;F.&quot; (The &quot;F&quot; you write does not need to look exactly like the one below, but it should look &quot;cursive.&quot;</p>

          <p>The &ldquo;coefficient of friction&rdquo; is the percentage of the normal force. It is found through experimentation and depends on the nature of the materials in contact.&nbsp; <span class="TextHighLight">Just because there is a normal force does not mean that there has to be a frictional force.</span>  If you were standing on a the slickest ice in the world, a normal force would be keeping your from sinking into the ice but the frictional force of the &ldquo;slickest&rdquo; ice in the world might have no measurable value.

          <td><p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tension exists in any body that is pulled by to opposing forces.&nbsp; Typically we talk about ropes and chains as being in tension but any body can be in put in tension. Tension is a pair of equal and opposite forces.</p>
          <p align="center"><img src="pics/Tension_Tug_of_War.png" width="313" height="52"></p>
          <p align="justify">In the drawing above the two 20 N forces represent the tension in the rope. The forces are equal in magnitude and pulling in opposite directions. A taught rope provides its own action reaction pair. The tension in the rope is said to be &ldquo;20 N.&rdquo; In the picture below, the girls' arms are in tension.</p>
          <p align="center"><img src="pics/Girl's Arms in Tension.jpg" width="682" height="512"></p>
          <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the clever features of tension and ropes has to do with corners and a single pulley. If the rope passes around a single pulley then the direction of the tension is redirected. Assuming the pulley is frictionless (as are all of our pulleys) then the tension's magnitude will remained unchanged. The symbol for tension is &quot;<span class="TextHighLight">T</span>.&quot; There is not  a formula for tension. Tension's value has to be either known in the problem or calculated from the other forces.</p>

          <p align="left">In order to have a tension your must have a rope or chain. You can also have a tension when any object  is being stretched. Like the arms of the girls in the photo above.</p>

        <tr>
          <td><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;net&quot; of anything is what is left over after everything is added and subtracted. Example: When you get hired for a job the employer promises $10 per hour. But when you get your paycheck your <span class="style3"><strong>NET</strong></span> pay is $7 per hour. This is because the federal government, state government and someone called &quot;FICA&quot; took out $ 3. What the employer could have said is that your pay is $10 per hour but your <span class="TextHighLight">net</span> pay will be $7 per hour.</p>
          <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a body is changing velocity the net force is not zero. This is because Newton's 2nd law says an unbalanced force is visually demonstrated by a body changing its velocity. The &quot;unbalanced&quot; force described earlier is actually known to physicists as the &quot;net force.&quot; Below is an example showing you what this looks like as well as the various free body diagrams. The net force is represented by the symbol,</p>
          <p align="center" class="TextHighLight">F<sub>NET</sub></span></p>

          <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;<span class="textBoldRed">The vector that represents the net force does not touch the body</span></strong>. This is because the &quot;net force&quot; is not a force that acts on the body. It is the mathematical result of adding up all the other forces. That is why it is called &quot;net.&quot;</p>
          <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note in the animation above how when the opposite force vectors are the same length the net force is zero and the body moves with a constant velocity.[ Examples &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D.&quot; ] When the force in one direction are bigger than the forces in the other directions, this is shown on the free body by having one arrow is longer than the other. When this happens the net force is not zero and the body accelerates or decelerates. [Examples &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B.&quot; ]</p>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The math used to model the situation is derived directly from the the free body diagram. </p>
